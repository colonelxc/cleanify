cleanify

Tired of seeing curse words in you terminal output?  Giving a live demo but are worried about what might show up on your screen?  Cleanify is here to help!

Put a list of all the words you don't like into badwords.txt, then pipe your output to cleanify.

If 'test' is in your badwords.txt, then cleanify works as follows:

> echo "123 test 123" | cleanify 
123 **** 123
